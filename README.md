# Screen and browser window sizes.

This is a starting component in which it is planned to collect all the methods for working with screen sizes.

In the near future it is planned to add additional parameters for the window, as well as update values in real time.

I'm thinking about how to visualize these methods so that they look more like infographics.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`
